/* THE BUG REPORT'S OWN REPRO, pinned: a tablet opens the flipbook, selects Byte's Delivery
   Mission, and TAPS PLAY. Reported as "the transition flickers, stutters, or momentarily
   freezes before abruptly loading the game screen" — measured at 15.9 fps with 11 freezes.

   curtain-perf.spec.js is NOT a substitute for this file. It drives .show/.part directly on
   a desktop viewport, so it never exercises welcomeThenStart(): the real tap ALSO swaps the
   screens, builds level 1, raises a full-viewport backdrop blur, and drives the flipbook
   overlay into fullscreen — all in the same frames the clouds are sweeping. A regression in
   any of that is invisible to the class-toggle guard but lands squarely on the learner.

   Deliberately NOT pinned: the cloud asset format. Converting SVG->WebP neither caused nor
   fixed this bug (deleting the cloud art entirely moved the frame rate 15.9 -> 15.2), so
   the format stays a free choice and nobody should "fix" a future stall by converting art. */
