  // line (the bowl box is 64 logical px tall, centre ±32, and the item draws BEHIND the dish, so the
  // depth is exactly how much of the item the bowl front laps over).
  //
  // Two failure modes, both seen in QA, bound the value:
  //  - too shallow: the item's bottom ends up ABOVE the bowl and it floats. Items used to be centred
  //    on the drop point, so the bottom depended on the item's box height — the tall bell/crown/vase
  //    (box 197) landed at +17..+28 and read as seated, the short ribbon (box 140) at -1..-11 and
  //    floated. That is the float QA reported.
  //  - too deep: a fixed depth swallows a short item. At +26 the bowl hid ~40% of the ribbon and cut
  //    across its flat base, while hiding only ~13% of the bell.
  // So the lap scales with the item — SEAT_FRACTION of its visible art height, capped at SEAT_DEPTH.
  // The ribbon gets ~17px and the bell ~24px: both clearly resting in the bowl, neither swallowed.
  // (The rim's exact line inside the bowl sprite isn't in the data, so these are tuned to what QA
  //  sees on screen; they are the only two numbers to touch if the tuck needs adjusting.)
  // SEAT_DEPTH is measured, not taste: the bowl is deep only in its middle (opaque down to y=63 around
  // its centre, but only y=31..47 toward its ends), so a WIDE item cannot sit as deep as a narrow one —
  // its outer columns drop past the bowl's silhouette and show under the pan. Comparing each item's
  // per-column opaque profile against the bowl's, the deepest lap that keeps EVERY item inside the bowl
  // (with 4px to spare) is 11px; the tightest item is the Tutorial's bell (120px of art). Going deeper
  // is what made the ribbon's tail, the Tutorial bell and the paper fan poke out below the rim.

  // Measured shape: peaks at 0.10s (a quick pop), settles back through a -1.7% undershoot (what
  // makes it read as springy rather than as a zoom), and is at rest again by 0.68s — then holds
  // perfectly still for 0.83s before the next one.
  //
  // Two channels only: LIFT and SWELL, straight up and straight back down. There was a third — a
  // small rotation — and it had to go: a wide rectangular button reads as crooked rather than

  // ---- tap-hint hand placement ----
  // The pointing-hand sprite (frame_00_delay-0.02s.webp) draws its hand in the LOWER-MIDDLE of a
  // mostly empty 1200x1200 frame — fingertip at ~52% of the frame height, wrist at ~80% — so the
  // node's box is nearly twice the size of the hand you can actually see, and the hand sits low
  // inside it. Centring that box on a button therefore does NOT put the finger on the button: it
  // drops the fingertip to the button's lower half and hangs the palm far below.
  //
  // Measured on the Part-2 and Part-4 Next buttons, whose centres sit at y=1016 in a 1080 stage:
  // the hand's box spanned 876..1156 and its visible art 1021..1101, i.e. the palm was cut off 21px
  // past the bottom edge and only the fingertip showed, over the button text. Exactly the report.

    /* ---- THE WHOLE BOX IS THE BUTTON -----------------------------------------------------------
       What the child sees as "the box" is TWO sibling nodes: the front box (the authored Button —
       boxImage, or boxInteractiveVisual on a level that supplies one) and the LID (boxTop), which is
       a LATER sibling and therefore painted ON TOP of the front box's upper half.

       The lid carries a Unity Button of its own, but its only authored call is an animator "Play",
       which the flow wiring ignores — so no handler is ever attached to it. engine.js nonetheless
       gives ANY node with a Button component pointer-events:auto (see build(), and the note there
       that names "the box lids" as exactly this case). The lid was therefore hit-testable and inert:
       a tap on the top face of the box landed on the lid and died there, because the real handler
       sits on a SIBLING — not an ancestor — so the click had nothing to bubble up to.

       Measured off the layout, the lid covers the top ~280 of the front box's ~650 logical px, and on
       the Tutorial / Level 2 / Level 4 it also stands 8–22px proud of it. That is the reported defect
       exactly: the upper ~45% of the box was dead and only the lower part opened it.

       So every leaf is wired to the one handler and the hit area is the UNION of their rects. Both
